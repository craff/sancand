# Sancand is a software licence. 

THIS IS A DRAFT LICENCE, CURRENTLY NOT EXAMINED BY ANY LAWYER! DO NOT USE IT YET. 

CONTRIBUTION ARE WELCOME AS LONG AS THEY FOLLOW THE IDEA BELOW. IT YOU WANT OTHER KIND
OF LICENCE, USE ANOTHER ONE!

It is not a free software licence, it enforces very strong rules about the organisation of the development of the software

It is a 
- source available software licence
- with no ownership (nobody owns the software, selling, destroying, damaging the software is not permitted)
- with the right to use the software for non commercial organisation or individual
- no right to distribute modified copies of the software
- some democratic rules for the managment of the software
- and some rules about contract to grant the right to use the software for commercial organisation

The goal of this licence is twofold:

- warrant as much as possible the future of the software using some democratic rules and avoid (in fact forbid) fork of the software
- bringing security to user of the software in particular commercial company buying the right to use the software. To this end, the 
  licence it transformed automatically in an open source licence if the supervisors of the software "disapear".

Last but not least: this licence should also allow a just remuneration of people that develop software outside of their primary job.
